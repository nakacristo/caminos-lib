## Generic routings

The most basic routing is to use any shortest path from the source to the destination. Note that for many traffic patterns using only these paths
make the packets flow through a few links, with enormous congestion.

```ignore
Shortest{
	legend_name: "minimal routing",
}
```

As solution for those cases problematic for shortest routing, Valiant proposed a randomization scheme. Each packet to be sent from a source to a destination is routed first to a random intermediate node, and from that intermediate to destination. These randomization makes the two parts behave as if the
traffic pattern was uniform at the cost of doubling the lengths.

See Valiant, L. G. (1982). A scheme for fast parallel communication. SIAM journal on computing, 11(2), 350-361.

```ignore
Valiant{
	first: Shortest,
	second: Shortest,
	legend_name: "Using Valiant scheme, shortest to intermediate and shortest to destination",
	//selection_exclude_indirect_routers: false,//optional parameter
}
```

As a routing that gives both short, long routes, and many intermediates we have the Polarized routing. It is recommended to have some mechanism to select among those routes based on network measures such as queue occupation.

- Camarero, C., Mart√≠nez, C., & Beivide, R. (2021, August). Polarized routing: an efficient and versatile algorithm for large direct networks. In 2021 IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects (HOTI) (pp. 52-59). IEEE.
- Camarero, C., Mart√≠nez, C., & Beivide, R. (2022). Polarized routing for large interconnection networks. IEEE Micro, 42(2), 61-67.

```ignore
Polarized{
	/// Include the weight as label, shifted so that the lowest weight is given the label 0. Otherwise it just put a value of 0 for all.
	include_labels: true,
	/// Restrict the routes to those that strictly improve the weight function at each step.
	/// Note that mmany/most topologies benefit from using routes that have a few edges with no change to the weight.
	/// Therefore one should expect too few routes when using this option.
	/// Strong polarized routes have maximum length of at most 2*diameter.
	strong: false,
	/// Whether to raise a panic when there are no candidates. default to true.
	/// It is to be set to false when employing in conjunction with another routing when Polarized return an empty set of routes.
	//panic_on_empty: true,
	/// Builds a `PolarizedStatistics{empty_count:XX,best_count:[XX,YY,ZZ]}` in the results.
	/// It tracks the number of first calls to `next` that returned an empty set and the number of times the best candidate was either +0, +1, or +2.
	/// defaults to false.
	//enable_statistics: false,
	/// Its name in generated plots.
	legend_name: "Polarized routing",
}
```

For topologies that define global links:
```ignore
WeighedShortest{
	class_weight: [1,100],
	legend_name: "Shortest avoiding using several global links",
}
```

For multi-stage topologies we may use
```ignore
UpDown{
	legend_name: "up/down routing",
}
```

There is a `Mindless` routing without parameters that includes all neighbours as candidates until reaching destination. Can be though as a random walk, if additionally the router would make its decisions randomly.

## Operations

### Sum
To use some of two routings depending on whatever. virtual channels not on either list can be used freely. The extra label field can be used to set the priorities. Check the router policies for that.
```ignore
Sum{
	policy: TryBoth,//or Random
	first_routing: Shortest,
	second_routing: Valiant{first:Shortest,second:Shortest},
	first_allowed_virtual_channels: [0,1],
	second_allowed_virtual_channels: [2,3,4,5],
	first_extra_label:0,//optional
	second_extra_label:10,//optiona
	legend_name: "minimal with high priority and Valiant with low priority",
}
```

### ChannelsPerHop
Modify a routing to use a given list of virtual channels each hop.
```ignore
ChannelsPerHop{
	routing: Shortest,
	channels: [
		[0],//the first hop from a router to another router
		[1],
		[2],
		[0,1,2],//the last hop, to the server
	],
}
```

### ChannelsPerHopPerLinkClass
Modify a routing to use a given list of virtual channels each hop.
```ignore
ChannelsPerHopPerLinkClass{
	routing: Shortest,
	channels: [
		[ [0],[1] ],//links in class 0.
		[ [0],[1] ],//links in class 1.
		[ [0,1] ],//links in class 2. Last class is towards servers. 
	],
}
```

### ChannelMap
```ignore
ChannelMap{
	routing: Shortest,
	map: [
		[1],//map the virtual channel 0 into the vc 1
		[2,3],//the vc 1 is doubled into 2 and 3
		[4],
	],
}
```

### AscendantChannelsWithLinkClass
Virtual channels are used in ascent way. With higher classes meaning higher digits.
```ignore
AscendantChannelsWithLinkClass{
	routing: Shortest,
	bases: [2,1],//allow two consecutive hops of class 0 before a hop of class 1
}
```

### Stubborn makes a routing to calculate candidates just once. If that candidate is not accepted is trying again every cycle.
```ignore
Stubborn{
	routing: Shortest,
	legend_name: "stubborn minimal",
}
```

## Cartesian-specific routings

### DOR

The dimensional ordered routing. Packets will go minimal along the first dimension as much possible and then on the next.

```ignore
DOR{
	order: [0,1],
	legend_name: "dimension ordered routing, 0 before 1",
}
```


### O1TURN
O1TURN is a pair of DOR to balance the usage of the links.

```ignore
O1TURN{
	reserved_virtual_channels_order01: [0],
	reserved_virtual_channels_order10: [1],
	legend_name: "O1TURN",
}
```

### OmniDimensional

McDonal OmniDimensional routing for HyperX. it is a shortest with some allowed deroutes. It does not allow deroutes on unaligned dimensions.

```ignore
OmniDimensionalDeroute{
	allowed_deroutes: 3,
	include_labels: true,//deroutes are given higher labels, implying lower priority. Check router policies.
	legend_name: "McDonald OmniDimensional routing allowing 3 deroutes",
}
```

### ValiantDOR

A proposal by Valiant for Cartesian topologies. It randomizes all-but-one coordinates, followed by a DOR starting by the non-randomized coordinate.

```ignore
ValiantDOR{
	randomized: [2,1],
	shortest: [0,1,2],
	randomized_reserved_virtual_channels: [1],
	shortest_reserved_virtual_channels: [0],
	legend_name: "The less-known proposal of Valiant for Cartesian topologies",
}
```
